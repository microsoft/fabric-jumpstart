- INSTALL: return jumpstart entry point on success (i.e. Notebook URL, Website link, etc.)
- visualize `items_in_scope`: can a graph be built to viz the resources that would be deployed?
- validate scenario and workload tags (needs to adhere to a known list)
- unit test to validate schema and fail if schema is wrong
- support workspace_name or id like semantic link?
- Deploy all jumpstarts to root folder in workspace? 
- Make `workspace` support ID or NAME
- move yaml validation to test module: pydantic moves to `test` dependency group and validate schema moves to test module
- add all Fabric Items within a folder to containerize the solution
- add user info about estimated deployment time
- add user info about estimated time to go through jumpstart
- review image rendering -> does it make more sense to render image from src repo? use rendering API?
