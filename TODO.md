- HTML of catalog to render when jumpstart.list() is called
- HTML: filter by scenario or workload
- HTML: render Jumpstart with NEW icon if date_added is within X days (i.e. 30 days)
- HTML: sort Jumpstarts by NEW first
- visualize `items_in_scope`: can a graph be built to viz the resources that would be deployed?
- validate scenario and workload tags (needs to adhere to a known list)
- unit test to validate schema and fail if schema is wrong
- support workspace_name or id like semantic link?
- Deploy all jumpstarts to root folder in workspace? 
- Make `workspace` support ID or NAME
- move yaml validation to test module: pydantic moves to `test` dependency group and validate schema moves to test module
